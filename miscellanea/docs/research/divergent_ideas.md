This document is a collection of ideas which follow a divergent path.

Let's think about convergent (common) ideas and create divergent thoughts by:
- exaggerating current settings
- remove one or more essential elements from a method
- ge inspired by similar situation, imagine one method applied to another context
- be serendipitous, we might find ideas that are solving another problem, not the one which we are thinking at the moment
- think with metaphors, how would this method look like if that would be a tree?
- imagine and visualize how that calculation could look like

Capture all the eureka moment and share them. Bring them in the world.

Change the question: ? + ? = 10 to find new answers.


To validate ideas: run experiments:
- A/B testing
- benchmark: create baselines
- benchmark: compare with other methods


Consider confirmation bias: we stick to results which confirm what we know already.
What if the cross-platform testing doesn't work for quantum programs?
Title: scalability in quantum cross-platform testing.

Think about innovation course from Davide Chiaroni POLIMI, the blue ocean strategy could help to create new ideas, similarly to how I combine products cross-functional or cross-emotional, in the same way I can combine methods in science to obtain new approaches.

Random Questions:
- What would be delta debugging without delta sets? What can replace them?


Exercise to improve creativity:
1. continuous practice: start from a word and create other 3 completely random words, as least associated as possible to the initial word. Try to do this as quick as possible.
2. Sleep on it: use the dreams to be creative. If you play Tetris before sleeping, then every participant was woken up in the dream sleep and each of them had some element of Tetris in their dreams. Think about the problem to solve right before sleeping, Try to wake up during a dream moment. Take note about everything related to the problem which I dreamt of.
3. Introduce randomness to your problem: define the problem and get a random wikipedia article. Can I force the information from wikipedia article to my problem.
