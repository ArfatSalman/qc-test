# Real algorithms with Qconvert and same number of shots = 8192 :
# Cirq, Qiskit

# Dataset of real programs
# - Famous Algorithms from QASMBench Medium (only 11/17)
# - TKet QASM benchmark programs (only those which were from the publication
#   arxiv-2003-10611 (qasm file folder), those with less or equeal than 20 qubits
#   with exactly one quantum register and one classical register and the
#   size of the classical register is equal or bigger than the quantum. Then the
#   quantum register is completely measured.)

# Every platform executes the same programs multiple times so that all
# combinations of two platform executions are used to create a more
# reliable p-value. In that way only very discordant cases will be highlighted.

# Here we care about the expected_divergence keyword.
